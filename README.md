#Phindle* : Create Kindle Mobi files, easier#

##Prerequisites##

Unfortunately, the command line utility `kindlegen` is a prerequisite of Phindle. It is not something that can be installed via composer and so I wanted to mention it first before anything else because it needs to be installed manually. `kindlegen` is a tool **provided free by Amazon** for creating mobi ebook files from a variety of different input formats, including most notably (for us) .html files. 

[**`kindlegen` can be downloaded here**](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)

##What does Phindle do?##

In short, Phindle provides a ebook skeleton that can be filled out with your content, and then Phindle will create friendly static html files (temporarily!) to feed `kindlegen` with. Additionally Phindle provides a number of useful ways that you can provide content.


####* Phindle is an absolutely brilliant combination of the language "php" and the word "kindle." It doesn't get much better than this.
